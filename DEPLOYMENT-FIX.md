# Railway 502 Fix - Deployment Steps

## 🔧 Problems Fixed

1. **Environment Variables**: Added proper NODE_ENV=production
2. **Static File Path**: Fixed path detection for Railway vs local
3. **File Serving**: Added fallback logic and debugging
4. **Railway Detection**: Added RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT flag

## 🚀 Deploy to Railway

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix 502 error: proper environment and static file serving"
git push origin main
```

## 🧪 Test After Deployment

### 1. Health Check

```
GET https://your-app.railway.app/health
```

Should return:

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "environment": "production",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

### 2. Debug Endpoint

```
GET https://your-app.railway.app/api/debug
```

Should return:

```json
{
  "staticPath": "/app/frontend/build",
  "staticFilesExist": true,
  "environment": {
    "NODE_ENV": "production",
    "RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT": "true",
    "PORT": "8080"
  },
  "indexHtmlExists": true
}
```

### 3. Frontend

```
GET https://your-app.railway.app/
```

Should return the React app (not 502 error)

## 📋 Railway Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in Railway dashboard:

**Required:**

- `DATABASE_URL` - Your database connection string
- `JWT_SECRET` - Your JWT secret key
- `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` - Your refresh token secret
- `COOKIE_SECRET` - Your cookie secret
- `DEVICE_HMAC_SECRET` - Your device secret

**Auto-set by Railway:**

- `NODE_ENV=production` (set in railway.toml)
- `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT=true` (set in railway.toml)
- `PORT` (automatically managed by Railway)

## 🎯 Expected Results

After deployment, you should see in Railway logs:

```
✅ Serving static files from: /app/frontend/build
📍 Server running on 0.0.0.0:8080
🌍 Environment: production
```

And the app should be accessible without 502 errors! 🚀
