# üöÄ Railway Deployment Guide for Lucky Voucher System

This guide will help you deploy the Lucky Voucher System to Railway platform with MySQL database.

## Prerequisites

1. **Railway Account**: Sign up at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. **Railway CLI**: Install via `npm install -g @railway/cli`
3. **Git Repository**: Your code should be in a Git repository

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### 1. Setup Railway CLI

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login
```

### 2. Create New Railway Project

```bash
# Initialize new Railway project
railway init lucky-voucher-system

# This will create a new project in your Railway dashboard
```

### 3. Deploy MySQL Database

1. Go to your Railway dashboard
2. Click "New Service" ‚Üí "Database" ‚Üí "Add MySQL"
3. Wait for the database to provision
4. Note down the connection details from the "Connect" tab

### 4. Deploy Backend Service

```bash
# Create backend service
railway service create backend

# Link to backend service
railway service connect backend

# Set environment variables
railway variables set NODE_ENV=production
railway variables set PORT=3001

# Deploy backend
railway up --dockerfile Dockerfile.backend
```

#### Backend Environment Variables to Set in Railway Dashboard:

```bash
# Database (get these from your MySQL service)
DB_HOST=mysql-host-from-railway
DB_PORT=3306
DB_NAME=railway
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your-mysql-password

# Security (generate strong random strings)
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-minimum-32-chars
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your-super-secret-refresh-key-minimum-32-chars
COOKIE_SECRET=your-super-secret-cookie-key-minimum-32-chars
DEVICE_HMAC_SECRET=your-super-secret-device-hmac-key

# Email (optional - for notifications)
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
EMAIL_FROM=Lucky Voucher System <noreply@luckyvoucher.com>

# SMS (optional - for notifications)
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your-twilio-account-sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your-twilio-auth-token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1234567890

# Features
ENABLE_OTP_VERIFICATION=false
ENABLE_RECAPTCHA=false

# CORS
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend-domain.railway.app
```

### 5. Deploy Frontend Service

```bash
# Create frontend service
railway service create frontend

# Link to frontend service
railway service connect frontend

# Set environment variables
railway variables set NODE_ENV=production
railway variables set PORT=3000
railway variables set REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend-domain.railway.app/api

# Deploy frontend
railway up --dockerfile Dockerfile.frontend
```

### 6. Configure Custom Domains (Optional)

1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Select your service
3. Go to "Settings" ‚Üí "Domains"
4. Add your custom domain
5. Update DNS records as instructed

### 7. Database Migration and Seeding

The backend will automatically run migrations and seeding on first startup. You can also run them manually:

```bash
# Connect to backend service
railway service connect backend

# Run migrations
railway run npm run migrate

# Run seeding (creates default admin user)
railway run npm run seed
```

## Important Configuration

### Backend CORS Settings

Make sure your backend allows requests from your frontend domain. Update the CORS configuration in your backend if needed.

### Default Admin Credentials

After seeding, you can login to the admin panel with:

- **Email**: admin@luckyvoucher.com
- **Password**: admin123

**‚ö†Ô∏è Change these credentials immediately after first login!**

### Security Checklist

- [ ] Set strong, unique JWT secrets
- [ ] Configure proper CORS origins
- [ ] Change default admin password
- [ ] Set up email/SMS providers for notifications
- [ ] Enable HTTPS (Railway provides this automatically)
- [ ] Configure proper environment variables

## Service URLs

After deployment, you'll get URLs like:

- **Frontend**: `https://lucky-voucher-frontend-production.up.railway.app`
- **Backend**: `https://lucky-voucher-backend-production.up.railway.app`
- **Database**: Internal connection (not publicly accessible)

## Testing Your Deployment

1. **Backend Health Check**: Visit `https://your-backend-url/health`
2. **Frontend**: Visit your frontend URL
3. **Admin Panel**: Visit `https://your-frontend-url/admin/login`
4. **API Test**: Try creating a spin via the frontend

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Database Connection Errors**:

   - Check DB environment variables
   - Ensure database service is running

2. **CORS Errors**:

   - Update FRONTEND_URL in backend environment
   - Check REACT_APP_API_URL in frontend

3. **Build Failures**:

   - Check build logs in Railway dashboard
   - Ensure all dependencies are listed in package.json

4. **404 Errors on Frontend Routes**:
   - This is normal for SPAs, the app handles routing internally

### Getting Help:

- Railway Documentation: https://docs.railway.app/
- Railway Discord: https://discord.gg/railway
- Project Issues: Check your Git repository issues

## Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Logs**: View logs in Railway dashboard
2. **Metrics**: Monitor usage and performance
3. **Backups**: Railway handles database backups automatically
4. **Updates**: Deploy updates by pushing to your Git repository

## Cost Optimization

- Railway offers $5/month free tier
- Monitor usage in dashboard
- Scale services based on actual needs
- Consider turning off development services when not needed
